    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey I am Umair Kamran, a Computer Engineer with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and building impactful digital solutions. With a solid academic background and hands-on experience in software development, I specialize in full-stack web development, backend programming, and intuitive user interface design.
