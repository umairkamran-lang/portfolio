      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey I  am Umair Kamran, a Computer Engineer with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and building impactful digital solutions. With a solid academic background and hands-on experience in software development, I specialize in full-stack web development, backend programming, and intuitive user interface design.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my journey, I have worked on various projects that reflect my ability to turn ideas into fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code, structured architecture, and a focus on both performance and usability.
        <br><br>
        My technical toolkit includes languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, MySQL, and modern tools like Flutter and Firebase. I am also comfortable working with version control systems like Git and collaborating in team-based environments.
        <br><br>
        What drives me most is the opportunity to keep learning and growing in a field that constantly evolves. Whether I’m working on the frontend to deliver engaging user experiences or building robust backend systems to power applications, I always aim for excellence, efficiency, and scalability.
        <br><br>
        As I continue to advance in my career, I look forward to contributing to meaningful projects, collaborating with like-minded professionals, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology.
